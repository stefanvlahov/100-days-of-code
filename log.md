# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Head First Java Chapter 7: Inheritance and Polymorphism

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot about the flexibility and cleanliness that polymorphism can add to a Java program.
Something new that I learned is that one can use the superclass and the subclass version of a method within the
same subclass! I will need to read up on this further as it's something I've yet to see in real world code.

**Link to work:** Coming soon!

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Conditional Logic, Looping and Arrays in Java

**Thoughts:** Currently taking the Java Fundamentals Course on Pluralsight beginner level. I was happy to
learn about the Switch statement which is a very underrated construct in professional development settings.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Representing Complex Types with Classes in Java

**Thoughts:** The topic of Objects and Classes in Java is probably the most fundamental building block to
understanding OOP. This is a topic I plan on revisiting often over the next 100 days. I especially want to
gain a better understanding of the public and private access modifiers of variables.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Multiplication Table In Java Using TDD - one test still failing

**Thoughts:** TDD is so difficult for me. Sometimes it feels like thinking backwards. I'm doing these
simple programming problems in TDD so that I can hopefully get used to the process.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Aspect Oriented Spring Framework in Java

**Thoughts:** Today I read about Aspects in Spring (Spring in Action book). I also coded a small demo showing
how aspects are used to create certain actions (logging or otherwise) in a small Spring Boot app.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A List Apart Article and First 5 HackerRank 30 Days of Code Challenges in Java

**Thoughts:** It's a bit of a cheat, since I did the 30 Days of Code challenges about 5 months ago. But
I wanted to redo them this time with minimal amount of "research". I am pleasantly surprised by how far I've come.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Head First Java Chapter 7: Interfaces and Polymorphism

**Thoughts:** This was a great chapter on OOP and how it allows us to type cleaner code and separating
the classes by what they do, not just what they are. I am still having some trouble with the referencing
the Object class, but I understand it a lot better than before.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class Initializers and Constructors in Java

**Thoughts:** This was the first time I saw Initialization Blocks and the ability to chain
Constructors together. I will definitely do further reading to improve my knowledge of these concepts.

### Day 8: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Multiplication Table In Java Using TDD - Completed!

**Thoughts:** I am done with this easy Java Kata. The next one I want to do is one that prints out all
prime numbers. It should be fun!

### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting Up A Spring MVC using IntelliJ

**Thoughts:** Spring MVC project setup is notoriously difficult due to all of the weird parts and
dependencies that need to be taken into account. I was able to start the setup, but I'm stuck n how to include
my JSP file :(.

**Link to work:** Coming Soon!

### Day 10: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: HackerRank 30 Days of Code Challenges in Java - Day 6 and Day 7 and
FreeCodeCamp HTML & CSS Section (up to part 48).

**Thoughts:** Day 6 and 7 are much more difficult then the first five. One of them requires two separate for
loops nested within a third!!! FreeCodeCamp is super fun - the HTML section is very well done!

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Constructors and Garbage Collection in Java
FreeCodeCamp HTML & CSS Section (finished).

**Thoughts:** Happy to be reviewing Constructors again. They may be the most important part of OOP, because
how can it work without Object creation. The Constructor Chaining concept is one I'm finally beginning to
gain an understanding of. I also liked reviewing some Front-End stuff on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 12: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Parameters in Java
FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design With Bootstrap (started).

**Thoughts:** Interesting to learn about Parameter Overloading and the flexibility it allows when
you need multiple method configurations. The idea of a "variable value" parameter is brand new to me.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Head First Java Chapter 7: Inheritance and Polymorphism

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot about the flexibility and cleanliness that polymorphism can add to a Java program.
Something new that I learned is that one can use the superclass and the subclass version of a method within the
same subclass! I will need to read up on this further as it's something I've yet to see in real world code.

**Link to work:** Coming soon!

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Conditional Logic, Looping and Arrays in Java

**Thoughts:** Currently taking the Java Fundamentals Course on Pluralsight beginner level. I was happy to
learn about the Switch statement which is a very underrated construct in professional development settings.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Representing Complex Types with Classes in Java

**Thoughts:** The topic of Objects and Classes in Java is probably the most fundamental building block to
understanding OOP. This is a topic I plan on revisiting often over the next 100 days. I especially want to
gain a better understanding of the public and private access modifiers of variables.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Multiplication Table In Java Using TDD - one test still failing

**Thoughts:** TDD is so difficult for me. Sometimes it feels like thinking backwards. I'm doing these
simple programming problems in TDD so that I can hopefully get used to the process.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
